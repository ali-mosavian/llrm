//! LLVM's `PatternMatch.h` on MIR: the `m_*` matchers ValueTracking uses.
//!
//! # How it works
//! Each matcher takes an operand and answers what the operand is: the operands
//! of the binary operation it is, the constant it is. One function per `m_*`,
//! named for it. Add the matcher a translation needs here, at the end, under a
//! comment naming the file that needs it; two files needing one matcher share
//! it.
//!
//! # Example
//! `binary(q, v, BinaryOp::And)` on `%y = and i32 %a, 7` is `Some((%a, 7))`.
