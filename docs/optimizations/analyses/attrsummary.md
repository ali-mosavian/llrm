# attrsummary

`Summary` for each defined function, derived from its attributes alone.

The drop-in for `alias::summaries` that the call-effect readers move onto:
what `FunctionAttrs` states (`memory(...)`, `readonly`, `writeonly`,
`nocapture`) in the shape `Summary` has.

- `argmem` access is a whole-object slice of each pointer parameter that
  `readnone`, `readonly` and `writeonly` do not rule out.
- Any other location (`other`, `inaccessiblemem`, `errnomem`) is an unknown
  read or write.
- A pointer parameter without `nocapture` is captured.

DEVIATE A1: no slices of tracked globals. `GlobalsModRef` answers those per
global; here they are the unknown access. Checked by
`the_unknown_access_stands_for_globals`.
