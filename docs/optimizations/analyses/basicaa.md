# basicaa

BasicAA, a translation of `BasicAliasAnalysis.cpp` at d1106deb71cc behind
the interface of [`crate::aa`](aa.md) (stage S1/S2 of
docs/architecture/basicaa-port.md). Per query: nothing is solved for the
whole function, and what one query learns lives in its `AAQueryInfo`.

Translated: `aliasCheck` (empty locations, casts stripped, the same value,
the underlying objects, identified objects, arguments against function-local
objects, an escape source against a non-captured local object, an access
larger than the whole object), `DecomposeGEPExpression` (constant offsets,
variable indices by value and scale), `subtractDecomposedGEPs` and
`aliasGEP` as far as it needs no value ranges: the inbounds and
constant-difference rules, nuw, and the GCD test. Not yet (deviations in the
plan page): `GetLinearExpression` through casts, `analyzeVariableOffsets`'
ranges, `aliasPHI`, `aliasSelect`, the mod/ref queries (they answer the top
of the lattice).
