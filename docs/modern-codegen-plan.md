# Modern code-generation plan status

This is the live state of the GCC/LLVM-quality plan.  A checked item means
the mechanism is in the production pipeline with a focused regression; it
does **not** mean the final quality gate has passed.  Each implementation
iteration updates this file in the same commit.

## Acceptance state

- [ ] Every supported CPU has hand-audited, candidate-ABI targets and meets
  the 1.10 structural/dynamic limits.  `bench/c/targets.json` is intentionally
  still empty, so this gate is not claimed.
- [ ] The complete BASIC/C matrix and QCport integration have passed at the
  final acceptance revision.
- [ ] QCport's C loops have a reproducible, source-line-mapped BCC/WC
  comparison.  The existing executable-only audit is advisory because its
  source revision cannot be proven.

## Implementation state

| Phase | State | Current boundary |
|---|---|---|
| Per-CPU measurement | in progress | CPU profiles, C corpus, static/dynamic metrics and reference listings exist; audited targets remain. |
| MIR/LIR provenance and fresh OMF | largely complete | allocated LIR emits directly with external source maps/allocation hints; legacy object-rewrite compatibility remains. |
| SROA and scalar promotion | partial | fixed/disjoint leaves and some indexed leaves promote; general aggregate/copy decomposition remains. |
| Pressure-aware allocation | partial | spilling, slot colouring, selected folds and local rematerialization exist; global splitting/rematerialization and x87 allocation remain. |
| Loop optimization | partial | exact recurrences, formula costing, specialization, peeling and exact unrolling exist; versioning, rotation and broad pressure forecasting remain. |
| Whole-module optimization | partial | summaries, constant returns, private inlining and private procedure DCE exist; full IPSCCP/cloning and private-data DCE remain. |
| Post-allocation quality | partial | copy propagation, machine CSE/DCE and C-path tail sharing exist; source-map-aware BC tail sharing and CPU scheduling remain. |

## Iteration log

### 1. Best-case GCC/LLVM listing contract — 2026-09-18

`tools/quality.py --references` now records a formal
`best-case-flat-i386-structural-reference` contract in its top-level report,
each compiler listing, and every structural comparison.  It says explicitly
that flat 32-bit GCC/LLVM output is an advisory reference for algorithmic loop
shape, expression count and memory traffic—not an ABI-equivalent target for
the segmented 16-bit medium model.  The focused report regression and a real
GCC/Clang sieve listing generation both pass.

Next: retain source-line-address evidence in a paired clean QCport BCC/WC
build, then use it to validate or reject the `r_recursive_world_node` loop
regression before changing allocation or aliasing for that case.

### 2. Reproducible QCport compiler listings — 2026-09-18

`tools/qcport_listings.py` creates matched BCC `-S` and qbopt assembly listings
from a clean QCport worktree, plus a hash manifest covering the QCport and
qbopt commits, every input source, CPU profile, output listing and stage dump.
It rejects a dirty source tree rather than comparing stale binaries to edited
loops.  The next run must use a clean QCport worktree and retain the manifest
with any loop-level regression or performance claim.

### 3. QCport `r_walk` evidence — 2026-09-18

The harness was run on a detached, clean QCport worktree at `18f5e1f`, for
`src/render/r_walk.c` SHA-256
`e5abf5f8fb67c3cac011579fcb980bff446ab068c130dd2c196652bbf802fef0`.
BCC's CodeView listing maps the marked-face loop directly to line 50.  Its
complete loop body is 16 instructions: it retains `world` in DI and `rdr` in
SI, then uses `les` and a byte RMW.  qbopt emits 24 instructions for the same
iteration: it reloads both incoming pointer bases from the frame, reloads their
selectors, and widens the byte RMW through word temporaries.

The first excess is present in MIR, where the loop still loads `world->lfc`
and `rdr->pflag`; allocation makes the incoming pointer values cheap frame
rematerializations instead of splitting their live ranges around the call-free
loop.  This confirms a general phase-4 region-splitting and pressure issue.
Do not add a `r_walk` special case: the next implementation must preserve
profitable invariant values across any call-free loop and include a
source-independent fail-first regression.
